# A3AntiStasi

## Summary
Arma 3 Mission "AntiStasi".

This is a fork of the original "AntiStasi" Mission by Barbolani, which can be found ![here on github aswell](https://github.com/A3Antistasi/antistasiofficial).

## Changes
These are the changes made to the original version of this mission:

  * **Zeus support:** The server admin now automatically has access to the Zeus ingame editor.
  * **Advanced Vehicle Buy System:** The types of vehicles that can be bought by the player faction is now based on their army level. This means that with every level gained, the vehicles get better and stronger, and more expensive. This allows the strength of the player faction to scale better over time.
